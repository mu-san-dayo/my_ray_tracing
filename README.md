# 42Cursus project Level4 "miniRT"

## *Description

    This program is to generate images using the Raytracing protocol. 
    Those computer generated images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system.
    (Minilibx is a small graphics library that can render something to the screen.)

## *Available Functions

    open, close, read, write, printf, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit
    All functions of the math library (-lm man man 3 math)
    All functions of the MinilibX

## *Usage

```bash
make && ./miniRT <***.rt>
```

You can save images as bmp file.
